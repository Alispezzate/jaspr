In the standard configuration, `jaspr` creates its own http server to handle incoming requests and
render your components. For this it uses the popular `shelf` package.

If you want, you can customize the server implementation or completely replace it with your own.
This allows also the use of your favorite dart backend framework.

## Custom Shelf Middleware

You can add custom shelf middleware to `jaspr`s http server, for example to log requests or add
additional api endpoints.

First replace your `runApp` method with the `runServer` method. This will return an instance of
the `ServerApp` class that allows you to customize certain aspects of the http server.

```dart
void main() {
  // Similar to [runApp], but returns an instance of [ServerApp]
  var serverApp = runServer(App());
  
  // Attach a listener that is called when the server was started successfully
  serverApp.setListener((server) {
    // [server] is the [HttpServer] used to serve your app
    print('Serving at http://${server.address.host}:${server.port}');
  });
  
  // Adds the [logRequests] middleware to log all incoming requests
  serverApp.addMiddleware(logRequests);
  
  // Adds another shelf middleware. It takes a shelf handler and can modify,
  // redirect or intercept incoming requests.
  serverApp.addMiddleware((handler) {
    return (request) {
      // inspect or modify [request]
      
      // e.g. reroute to a custom handler
      if (request.url.path.startsWith('api')) {
        return handleApi(request.change(path: 'api'));
      }
      
      // this will continue with normal server side rendering
      return handler(request);
    };
  });
}

FutureOr<Response> handleApi(Request request) {
  return Response.ok('FROM API');
}
```

This code will respond `FROM API` to all requests under the `/api` endpoint, and render
the `App()` component for all other requests.

## Custom Backend

If this is not enough, you can go one step further and use a custom backend framework.

> Since `jaspr` is built with `shelf`, this works best when the backend framework is also compatible with shelf.
> However you can work around this if that is not the case.

There are two main functions, that enable this:

- `Handler serveApp(AppHandler handler)` bundles everything jaspr does on the server into a custom shelf handler.
  The handler can then be passed to your backend or server implementation.
- `String renderComponent(Component app)` directly renders the provided component into a html string.

> When using your own backend setup, you can still do `jaspr serve`, however auto-reload won't work 
> on the server then.

> When you are not using `jaspr serve`, you need to run webdev manually with 
> `dart run webdev serve web:5467` and provide the `jaspr_dev_proxy=5467` env var to your server process.

## Example: Dart Frog

[`dart_frog`](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev/) is a popular backend framework built by Very Good Ventures. You
can combine it with jaspr to build powerful fullstack web applications that use dart_frog for managing
the backend api and jaspr for rendering the frontend app.

Check out our [dart_frog_backend example](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/tree/develop/examples/dart_frog_backend)
to see this in action.

With this, a `dart_frog` route that renders a jaspr component can be as simple as:

```dart
// routes/[my_component_path]/index.dart
Future<Response> onRequest(RequestContext context) {
  return renderJasprComponent(context, MyComponent());
}
```
