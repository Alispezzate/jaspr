# ðŸ•¹ Jaspr CLI

Jaspr comes with a cli tool to create, serve and build your web app.

- `jaspr create -t <template> <project-name>` will create a new jaspr project based on `<template>`inside the `<project-name>` directory
- use `jaspr create` to see a list of available templates
- `jaspr serve` will serve the web-app in the current directory, including hot-reloading
- `jaspr build` will build the web-app containing the static web assets (compiled js, html, ...) and the server executable

## ðŸ“Ÿ Execution Mode

**Jaspr** is a full-stack web framework, meaning it runs both on the server and the client. However
depending on what you want to build you can choose how your app should be built and executed using jaspr.

- **Server-side Rendering with client-side hydration:**
  In the default mode jaspr runs both on the server and client. It renders your html on the server
  including any dynamic data from an api or database and then hydrates that html on the client in order to
  make it interactive. This is the default mode for the `basic`, `classic` and `islands` templates.

- **Client-side only:**
  If you want, you can skip the server part of jaspr completely and only use it as a client-side framework.
  To use it like this, simply use the `client` template when creating a new project.

- **Server-side only:**
  If you are dealing with a fully static website without needing any interactivity through js, you can also
  use jaspr as a purely server-side rendering framework. To set this up, use the `server` template when creating
  a new project. Then you won't have any javascript shipped to the browser.

## ðŸ›  Building

When it's time to deploy your application, you can build it using the following command:

```shell
jaspr build
```

This will build the app inside the `build` directory.
You can choose whether to build a standalone executable or an aot or jit snapshot with the `--target` option.

If you are using jaspr with server-side rendering (default), you can run your app by starting the
executable at `build/app` (when you deploy your app, make sure to also copy the `build/web` folder
next to the executable). If you passed the `--no-ssr` flag, you can deploy the files inside
the `build` directory to any static hosting provider.
