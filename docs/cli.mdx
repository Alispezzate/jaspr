# üïπ Jaspr CLI

Jaspr comes with a cli tool to create, serve and build your website.

- `jaspr create` will create a new jaspr project. The cli will prompt you for a project name and setup options.
- `jaspr serve` will serve the website in the current directory and automatically refresh when you make changes.
- `jaspr build` will build the website according to the selected rendering mode.

## üìü Rendering Modes

**Jaspr** is a full-stack web framework, meaning it can run both on the server and the client. Depending on what you
want to build you can choose how your app should be built and executed using Jaspr.

- **Static Mode**

  With this mode, Jaspr will generate a fully static site when building your project that you can host at any common website hosting service.
  You can write server-side code to pre-render components and pages at built time, outputting clean html and css to deploy anywhere.
  Additionally, you can set up hydration on the client in order to make your site interactive.

- **Server Mode**

  In this mode Jaspr runs and builds a server application that pre-renders your components for each incoming request.
  You can use either Jasprs inbuilt webserver or choose to integrate it into your favorite Dart backend framework.
  Additionally, you can set up hydration on the client in order to make your site interactive.

- **Client Mode**

  If you want, you can skip the server and pre-rendering part of Jaspr completely and use it as a client-side only framework.
  Similar to static mode, you can deploy your built site to any common website hosting service without needing an extra server.

## üèó Project Scaffolding

When creating a new project, you will go through a set of questions to configure the project to your liking.
The options set your rendering mode, hydration strategy, routing, flutter interoperability strategy and more.

<Info>
If you are just starting out and are not sure what options to pick, just select the default one for each question
(simply press Enter each time).
</Info>

<Info>
Choosing a set of options do not lock you into a specific configuration. Starting from one setup you can easily
modify your code to behave as any other setup along the way.
</Info>

## üõ† Building

When it's time to deploy your application, you can build it using the following command:

```shell
jaspr build
```

This will build the app inside the `build/jaspr` directory according to your selected **Rendering Mode**:

<Tabs defaultValue="st" values={[
    {label: 'static', value: 'st'},
    {label: 'server', value: 'sv'},
    {label: 'client', value: 'c'}
]}
>
<TabItem value="st">
All files are built to the `build/jaspr/` directory, which you can deploy to any static hosting provider.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sv">
You can choose whether to build a standalone executable, an aot snapshot or kernel module with the `--target` option.

Your server app will be compiled to `build/jaspr/app<.exe/.aot/.dill>`.

Your static files and assets will be built to the `build/jaspr/web` directory, which must be kept alongside the server executable.
