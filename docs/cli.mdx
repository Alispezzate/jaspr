# üïπ Jaspr CLI

Jaspr comes with a cli tool to create, serve and build your website.

- `jaspr create`: Create a new jaspr project.
- `jaspr serve`: Serve the project and automatically refresh when you make changes.
- `jaspr build`: Build the project according to the selected rendering mode.

Additionally, there are the following service commands available:

- `jaspr doctor`: Show information about the environment and current project.
- `jaspr clean`: Delete the `build/` and `.dart_tool/` directories.
- `jaspr update`: Update the jaspr cli.

## üèó Project Scaffolding

When creating a new project, you will go through a set of questions to configure the project to your liking.
The options set your rendering mode, hydration strategy, routing, flutter interoperability strategy and more.

<Info>
If you are just starting out and are not sure what options to pick, just select the default one for each question
(simply press Enter each time).
</Info>

<Info>
Choosing a set of options do not lock you into a specific configuration. Starting from one setup you can easily
modify your code to behave as any other setup along the way.
</Info>

## üõ† Building

When it's time to deploy your application, you can build it using the following command:

```shell
jaspr build
```

This will build the app inside the `build/jaspr/` directory according to your selected [**Rendering Mode**](/core/modes):

<Tabs defaultValue="st" values={[
    {label: 'static', value: 'st'},
    {label: 'server', value: 'sv'},
    {label: 'client', value: 'c'}
]}
>
<TabItem value="st">
All files are built to the `build/jaspr/` directory, which you can deploy to any static hosting provider.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sv">
You can choose whether to build a standalone executable, an aot snapshot or kernel module with the `--target` option.

Your server app will be compiled to `build/jaspr/app<.exe/.aot/.dill>`.

Your static files and assets will be built to the `build/jaspr/web` directory, which must be kept alongside the server executable.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="c">
All files are built to the `build/jaspr/` directory, which you can deploy to any static hosting provider.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
