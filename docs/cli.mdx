# üïπ Jaspr CLI

Jaspr comes with a cli tool to create, serve and build your web app.

- `jaspr create` will create a new jaspr project. The cli will prompt you for a project name and template to use.
- `jaspr serve` will serve the web-app in the current directory, including hot-reloading.
- `jaspr build` will build the web-app containing the static web assets (compiled js, html, ...) and the server executable.
- `jaspr generate` will generate all routes of your website at build time and build the web-app as a static site.

## üìü Execution Mode

**Jaspr** is a full-stack web framework, meaning it can run both on the server and the client. Depending on what you
want to build you can choose how your app should be built and executed using jaspr.

- **Server-side Rendering with client-side hydration:**
  In the default mode jaspr runs both on the server and client. It renders your html on the server
  including any dynamic data from an api or database and then hydrates that html on the client in order to
  make it interactive. This is the default mode for the `basic` and `classic` templates.

- **Client-side only:**
  If you want, you can skip the server part of jaspr completely and use it as a client-side only framework. This way
  you can deploy your built app to any static hosting provider (like firebase hosting) without needing an extra server.
  To use it like this, simply use the `client` template when creating a new project.

- **Server-side only:**
  If you are dealing with a fully static website without needing any interactivity through js, you can also
  use jaspr as a purely server-side rendering framework. To set this up, use the `server` template when creating
  a new project. Then you won't have any javascript shipped to the browser.

- **Static site generation:**
  Jaspr can also perform static site generation, meaning it can generate static pages at build time from your server-side
  components. This can be used with any project that has server-side rendering setup, simply by using `jaspr generate`
  instead of `jaspr build` when building and deploying your app.

## üèó Templates

When generating a new project, you can choose from one of several templates to get started quickly.
The templates showcase common configurations of jaspr and provide a ready-to use setup. 

<Info>
Templates do not lock you into a specific configuration. Starting from one template you can easily 
modify your code to behave as any other template along the way. So if you are not sure yet what to
pick, just start with the recommended 'basic' template.
</Info>

#### Basic Template

The **recommended** template for a standard jaspr app. It gives you a pure-dart web app with ssr & 
automatic client hydration.

#### Classic Template

Similar to the basic template, but with an additional `index.html` and `styles.css` file in case
you prefer to write your template in html and global styles in css.

#### Client Template

A pure client-side app without ssr. Allows your site to be deployed to a static file hosting
provider, like Firebase Hosting.

#### Server Template

A purely server-side rendered app without client hydration. This means you will have no generated
js and therefore no client interaction, but a completely static site, like a simple blog.

## üõ† Building

When it's time to deploy your application, you can build it using the following command:

```shell
jaspr build
```

This will build the app inside the `build/jaspr` directory.
You can choose whether to build a standalone executable or an aot or jit snapshot with the `--target` option.

If you are using jaspr with server-side rendering (default), you can run your app by starting the
executable at `build/jaspr/app` (when you deploy your app, make sure to also copy the `build/jaspr/web` folder
next to the executable). If you build with `uses-ssr: false`, you can deploy the files inside
the `build/jaspr` directory to any static hosting provider.
