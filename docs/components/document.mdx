# Document
*The `Document` component sets up and controls the basic document structure.*

---

The `Document` component helps you with the basic document structure of your website, the `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>`
elements. It has **5 constructors** that setup or control separate aspects of the document.

- The main `Document()` constructor and the `Document.template()` constructor setup the full document structure using either
  a set of child parameters or a template file respectively. These are **only available on the server** using the `package:jaspr/server.dart` import.

- The `Document.head()`, `Document.html()` and `Document.body()` constructors control the respective elements separately by
  attaching child elements (for `.head()`) or setting attributes (for `.html()` and `.body()`). These can be used both on the
  server and on the client.

## Document()

<Warning>
    The `Document()` constructor can only be used on the server and is only available using the
    `package:jaspr/server.dart` import.
</Warning>

The `Document()` constructor helps you to set up a basic document structure at the root of your app.
It renders the main `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags and takes a set of standard parameters, 
e.g. to set the `title` or `meta` attributes inside the `<head>`.

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
void main() {
  runApp(Document(
    title: "My Site",
    meta: {
      "description": "My site description",
    },
    body: div(id: "main", []),
  ));
}
```

renders to:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <base href="/"/>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <title>My Site</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
    <meta name="description" content="My site description"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="main"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Parameters

It takes the following parameters:

- `String? title`: Sets the title of your website.
- `String? base`: Sets the `<base>` tag of your website.
- `String? charset`: Sets the charset, defaults to 'utf-8'.
- `String? viewport`: Sets the viewport for mobile devices, defaults to 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'.
- `Map<String, String>? meta`: Sets additional `<meta>` properties.
- `List<StyleRule>? styles`: A global set of style-rules, rendered as a `<style>` section inside `<head>`.
- `List<Component> head`: Additional components to render inside `<head>`.
- `Component body`: The component to render inside `<body>`.

## Document.template()

<Warning>
    The `Document.template()` constructor can only be used on the server and is only available using the
    `package:jaspr/server.dart` import.
</Warning>

The `Document.template()` constructor loads an external `.template.html` file from the filesystem and attaches the provided
child component to that template.

It allows you to define the document markup in a separate html file instead of using the standard `Document()` constructor.

- The `name` parameter defines the file to load, e.g. `name: 'index'` (default) loads the `web/index.template.html` file.
- The `attachTo` parameter defined which target element from the template the `child` component to attach to, e.g. `attachTo: 'body'` (default)
  attaches it to the `body` element.

---

## Document.head()


The `Document.head()` constructor renders metadata and other elements inside the `<head>` of the document.

Any children are pulled out of the normal rendering tree of the application and rendered instead
inside a special section of the `<head>` element of the document. This is supported both on the
server during pre-rendering and on the client.

The `.head()` component can be used multiple times in an application where deeper or latter mounted
components will override duplicate elements from other `.head()` components.

```dart
Parent(children: [
  Document.head(
    title: "My Title",
    meta: {"description": "My Page Description"}
  ),
  Child(children: [
    Document.head(
      title: "Nested Title"
    ),
  ]),
]);
```

The above configuration of components will result in these elements inside `<head>`:

```html
<head>
  <title>Nested Title</title>
  <meta name="description" content="My Page Description">
</head>
```

<Warning>
Note that 'deeper or latter' here does not result in a true DFS ordering. Components that are mounted
deeper but prior will override latter but shallower components.
</Warning>

Elements inside `.head()` are overridden using the following system:
- elements with an `id` override other elements with the same `id`
- `<title>` and `<base>` elements override other `<title>` or `<base>` elements respectively
- `<meta>` elements override other `<meta>` elements with the same `name`

---

## Document.html()

The `Document.html()` constructor attaches a set of attributes to the `<html>` element.

This can be used at any point in the component tree and is supported both on the
server during pre-rendering and on the client.

The `.html()` component can be used multiple times in an application where deeper or latter mounted
components will override duplicate attributes from other `.html()` components.

<Warning>
Note that 'deeper or latter' here does not result in a true DFS ordering. Components that are mounted
deeper but prior will override latter but shallower components.
</Warning>

---

## Document.body()

The `Document.body()` constructor attaches a set of attributes to the `<body>` element.

This can be used at any point in the component tree and is supported both on the
server during pre-rendering and on the client.

The `.body()` component can be used multiple times in an application where deeper or latter mounted
components will override duplicate attributes from other `.body()` components.

<Warning>
Note that 'deeper or latter' here does not result in a true DFS ordering. Components that are mounted
deeper but prior will override latter but shallower components.
</Warning>
