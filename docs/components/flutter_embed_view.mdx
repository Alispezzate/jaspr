<Info>
This component is part of the `jaspr_flutter_embed` package. Make sure to add this to your dependencies
before using the component.
</Info>

With the `FlutterEmbedView` component you can embed any Flutter widget as part of your
Jaspr component tree. The component takes care of initializing the Flutter engine and attaching the provided widget
to the root of Flutters widget tree. It internally calls Flutters `runApp` method with the provided widget.

It renders a `<div id="flutter_target"></div>` element and mounts the flutter app inside.

You can provide the following parameters:

- `app`: The widget that will be run as your embedded Flutter app.
- `loader`: An optional component that is displayed while the flutter app is initializing.
- `classes`: Optional class name for the created `<div>` element.
- `styles`: Optional styles for the created `<div>` element.

```dart
yield FlutterEmbedView(
  // provide your flutter app widget
  app: MyFlutterApp(
    // provide any widget properties or callbacks
    // this way you can pass and share state between jaspr and flutter
    // without needing js interop
    title: 'My Embedded Flutter App',
  ),
  // provide an optional loader component that will be displayed while the flutter app loads
  loader: MyCustomLoader(),
);
```
