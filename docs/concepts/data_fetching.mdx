# Data Fetching
*Fetch data on the server during pre-rendering and sync data to the client.*

---


When using server side rendering, you want the ability to load some data asynchronously before rendering the components.
With `jaspr` this is build into the framework and easy to do.

## Loading Data on the Server

- Async data sources, server-side code
- Awaiting data loading on the server before pre-rendering

Options:

- Async components
- PreloadStateMixin


## Syncing Data to the Client

- from server to client (one directional)

- example. not enough to prerender html with the loaded data, also needed for mutations on the client

Options:

- @client annotation
- SyncStateMixin
