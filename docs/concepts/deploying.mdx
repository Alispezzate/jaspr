# Deploying
*Learn how to deploy your Jaspr site to any hosting provider.*

---

A website built with Jaspr can be deployed to nearly any standard web hosting provider. The form of deployment
depends on your chosen [Rendering Mode](/get_started/modes):

- **static**: Deploy your pre-rendered site to any static hosting provider.
- **server**: Deploy your server application to any Dart hosting provider or containerized hosting service using Docker.
- **client**: Deploy your site to any static hosting provider.

---

## Static Hosting

With **static** or **client** mode you will have a purely static site after running `jaspr build`. This means that you
can just take the `/build/jaspr` folder and deploy it to any static hosting provider.

### Firebase Hosting

### Github Pages

## Server Hosting

With **server** mode `jaspr build` will generate a server executable `app.exe` and an additional assets folder `web/`
to `/build/jaspr`. When deploying this executable, make sure to deploy the asset folder with it.

### Docker

### Cloud Run
