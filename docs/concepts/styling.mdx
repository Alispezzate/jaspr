*How to do styling in Jaspr.*

---

Jaspr gives you a strongly-typed styles system that wraps the most common css properties. You can
access these various properties through the `Styles` class that is exported by the core package.

To pass style attributes to a html component, construct a `Styles` object and pass it as the `styles`
attribute like this:

```dart
div(styles: const Styles.background(color: Colors.red), []);
```

This will render as:

```html
<div style="background: red"></div>
```
