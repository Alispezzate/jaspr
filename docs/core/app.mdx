## ðŸš€ Run your App

To run your app, use the `runApp` function and provide your root component.

```dart
runApp(MyComponent());
```

This function works both on the client and on the server when you use **static** or **server** mode.

1. **On the server** this starts a http server that renders the given component to html for every
   incoming request.
   
2. **On the client** this attaches the given component to the DOM and thereby making your app interactive.

## ðŸ“‹ The Document

The `Document` component helps you to set up a basic document structure at the root of your app.
It renders the main `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags and takes a set of standard parameters, 
e.g. to set the `title` or `meta` attributes inside the `<head>`.

The `Document` component can only be used on the server and is therefore also only available using the
`package:jaspr/server.dart` import.

The standard `Document` constructor takes the following arguments:

- `String? title`: Sets the title of your website.
- `String? base`: Sets the `<base>` tag of your website.
- `String? charset`: Sets the charset, defaults to 'utf-8'.
- `String? viewport`: Sets the viewport for mobile devices, defaults to 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'.
- `Map<String, String>? meta`: Sets additional `<meta>` properties.
- `List<StyleRule>? styles`: A global set of style-rules, rendered as a `<style>` section inside `<head>`.
- `List<Component> head`: Additional components to render inside `<head>`.
- `Component body`: The component to render inside `<body>`.

There are also one other constructors that you can use instead:

- **Document.template()** where you can use an external html template file that defines the document markup.
