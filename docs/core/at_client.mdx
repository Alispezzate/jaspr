# `@client` components


A component annotated with `@client` will be automatically hydrated on the client after it has been pre-rendered. In principle,
this is like 'resuming' the rendering for a component and picking up where the server-side rendering has left off.

A `@client` component acts as a 'boundary' between server and client. Components in the tree above will be rendered **only on
the server**, while components in the tree below will be rendered **both on the server and client**.

> For `@client` to work, make sure to call `Jaspr.initializeApp(options: defaultJasprOptions);`
> before `runApp();` in your `main.dart`.

The following happens when you use a `@client` component:

*on the server:*
1. The component is built and pre-rendered normally.
2. Jaspr adds a html marker around your components output.

*on the client:*
4. The browser loads the pre-rendered html and compiled js scripts.
5. The used component is located based on the html marker.
6. The component is mounted and built at the current location in the tree.

```dart
import 'package:jaspr/jaspr.dart';

// marks this as a client component
@client
class App extends StatelessComponent {
  @override
  Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
    yield ...;
  }
}
```


You can also have multiple components annotated with `@client` to have separate interactive 'islands' on the client.
However, nesting client components is currently not possible.
