## üñç Writing concise HTML

Every html element in jaspr is represented by a `DomComponent`, which takes a **tag**, some other parameters and a list of children, which can again be other `DomComponents`. While this gives you great low-level control over your html structure, building up larger html trees can feel verbose and boilerplaty.

Let's look at the following html snippet:

```html
<div>
  <h1>This is a title</h1>
  <p>Hello <b>World!</b></p>
</div>
```

When this is built using `DomComponent`s it might look like the following:

```dart
return DomComponent(
  tag: 'div',
  children: [
    DomComponent(
      tag: 'h1', 
      child: Text('This is a title'),
    ),
    DomComponent(
      tag: 'p',
      children: [
         Text('Hello '),
         DomComponent(
           tag: 'b',
           child: Text('World!'),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ],
);
```

Through its use of `tag` and `children`/`child`, it gets a lot longer than the original markup and looks kind of messy. In order to solve this, jaspr includes a set of **html utility methods** in order to write html structures in a more concise and clean way:

## üéÅ Import jaspr/html.dart

In order to use these utility methods, simply import `package:jaspr/html.dart` in your code. There are methods for the most common html tags, like `div`, `a`, `p`, `img` as well as more special tags like `video`, `form`, `input` and others.

The methods can be added to your component tree and the following parameters:

- any tag-specific attributes, like `src` for `img` or `href` for `a`,  
  (These are always typed and may be required depending on the tag.)
- any general parameters, like `id`, `styles`, `attributes` or `events`,  
  (These are always options.)
- a list of child components.  
  (Recommended to be specified at the end. For no children specify an empty list. Some tags omit this, e.g. `img`.)

For text content, use the `text()` utility method - this does not add a html tag but is needed to work with other components.

Our above example would then be reduced to this:

```dart
return div([
  h1([text('This is a title')]),
  p([text('Hello '), b([text('World!')])]),
]);
```

A more elaborate component tree using these methods may look like this:

[Check it out on JasprPad](https://jasprpad.schultek.de/?sample=html)

```dart
return div([
  // each element gets a list of child elements
  h1([text('jaspr/html')]),
  p([
    // wrap your strings with `text()` to add alongside other components
    text('This is some '),
    b([text('html')]),
    text(' content.'),
  ]),
  // some elements have typed attributes for easy access
  a(href: "https://github.com/schultek/jaspr", target: Target.blank, [
    img(src: "https://jasprpad.schultek.de/jaspr-192.png"),
  ]),
  // some elements don't have children
  hr(),
  // you can add events as usual
  select(events: {
    'change': (e) => print(e.target.value),
  }, [
    option(value: 'test', [text('Select me!')]),
    option(value: 'other', selected: true, [text('Or me!')])
  ]),
  // most common and some uncommon elements are supported
  progress(value: 85, max: 100, [])
]);
```
