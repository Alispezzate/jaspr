## ðŸ“Ÿ Rendering Modes

**Jaspr** is a full-stack web framework, meaning it can run both on the server and the client. Depending on what you
want to build you can choose how your app should be built and executed using Jaspr.

- **Static Mode**

With this mode, Jaspr will generate a fully static site when building your project that you can host at any common website hosting service.
You can write server-side code to pre-render components and pages at built time, outputting clean html and css to deploy anywhere.
Additionally, you can set up hydration on the client in order to make your site interactive.

- **Server Mode**

In this mode Jaspr runs and builds a server application that pre-renders your components for each incoming request.
You can use either Jasprs inbuilt webserver or choose to integrate it into your favorite Dart backend framework.
Additionally, you can set up hydration on the client in order to make your site interactive.

- **Client Mode**

If you want, you can skip the server and pre-rendering part of Jaspr completely and use it as a client-side only framework.
Similar to static mode, you can deploy your built site to any common website hosting service without needing an extra server.

## ðŸš° Hydration

<Info>
This section is only relevant when using **static** or **server** mode.
</Info>

**Hydration** is the process of making the initial pre-rendered html of a website interactive.

While pre-rendering your components on the server (or at built time with 'static' mode) allows for a fast "first contentful paint"
(when useful content is first displayed to the user), the site is not interactive (e.g. responding to button clicks) until the
client-side rendering is started and event handlers have been attached.

For this to happen seamlessly the initial client-side render has to match the previously pre-rendered html exactly.

Hydration is achieved by simply re-executing the same components that have previously pre-rendered the html on the server also
on the client as soon as the browser loads the page.

With Jaspr you can handle hydration in two ways:

- **manually** by writing both server and client entrypoints separately, or
- **automatically** by using the `@client` annotation.

<Info>
It is generally recommended to use automatic hydration.
