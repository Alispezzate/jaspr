# ðŸ“š Third-Party Packages

This page lists third-party packages built for jaspr that are maintained by great people 
from the community. ðŸ’™

## State-Management Packages

Jasprs component system is conceptually and implementation-wise very close to Flutters 
widget system. This makes it rather easy to port popular Flutter state-management packages to jaspr.

As an example, jaspr has its own official port of `flutter_riverpod` called [`jaspr_riverpod`](/eco/riverpod).

From the community, there also exists ports for:

- [jaspr_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/jaspr_provider)
- [jaspr_bloc](https://github.com/f-person/jaspr_bloc)

## CSS Frameworks

Since jaspr works with native web technology and css, it is possible to build dart wrappers around 
css frameworks that expose jaspr components.

There currently exist no such published package, but some resources include:

- [jaspr_bootstrap](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/tree/develop/thirdparty/jaspr_bootstrap) (work in progress)
- [bulma sample for jasprpad](https://jasprpad.schultek.de/?sample=bulma)

## UI Component Libraries

There are currently no existing ui component libraries for jaspr. Feel free to create one. ðŸ’™
