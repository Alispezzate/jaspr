# üåä Riverpod for Jaspr

Jaspr comes with a riverpod package that ports over flutter_riverpod to Jaspr. It is based
on Riverpod 2 and supports all providers and modifiers.

**TLDR: Differences to flutter_riverpod**

- No `Consumer` / `ConsumerComponent`, just use `context.read` / `context.watch`
- Additional `.onSync()` and `.onPreload()` available on a providers `ref`.

## ü™Ñ Accessing Providers

While it has feature-parity for defining `Provider`s, it comes with some quality-of-life improvements
on the `Consumer` side. Mainly: 

**It does not have `Comsumer`, `ComsumerWidget` or `StatefulConsumerWidget`.** This is because it 
does not rely on `WidgetRef` to access providers but instead comes with **context extensions** on the
`BuildContext` of **any** component.

As an example, this:

```dart
// (Flutter)
// need to extend custom ConsumerWidget
class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  // need to accept custom WidgetRef
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    // uses ref to access providers
    var value = ref.watch(myProvider);
    return Text(value);
  }
}
```

can simply be written as

```dart 
// (Jaspr)
// just extends the normal component
class MyComponent extends StatelessComponent {
  // no extra parameter
  Iterable<Component>(BuildContext context) sync* {
    // uses context to access providers
    var value = context.watch(myProvider);
    yield Text(value);
  }
}
```

The extension on `BuildContext` supports all the normal methods from `WidgetRef``

- `context.read()`,
- `context.watch()`,
- `context.refresh()`,
- `context.invalidate()`,
- `context.listen()`

#### Replacement for Consumer

Same as with `ConsumerComponent`, we don't need the `Consumer` anymore. If you want only parts of your
component tree to rebuild when watching a provider, simply use the `Builder` component. This will
give you a new context which you can call `context.watch` on:

```dart
Builder(
  builder: (context) sync* {
    var value = context.watch(...);
    yield ...;
  },
);
```

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Preloading and Syncing Provider State

Jaspr allows `StatefulComponent`s to preload state as well as sync state between server and client
(when using server-side rendering).

Since providers often are used to replace `StatefulComponent`s, `jaspr_riverpod` offers the same
mechanisms inside a provider, using the `ref.onPreload()` and `ref.onSync()` methods:

Preload state like this:

```dart
final myProvider = Provider<int>((ref) {
  
  ref.onPreload(() async {
    // do some async work on the server
    ref.state = 100;
  });

  return 0;
});
```

Sync state like this:

```dart
final myProvider = Provider<int>((ref) {
  
  ref.onSync<int>(
    id: 'my-provider-id',
    onUpdate: (int? value) {
      ref.state = value ?? ref.state;
    },
    onSave: () {
      return ref.state;
    },
  );

  return 0;
});
```

## üìú Backstory: Why context extensions instead of Consumer?

Put simply: Because they are easier and more flexible to use and require less boilerplate.

The actual question would be why they are not in flutter_riverpod in the first place.
This is because mainly `context.watch` is [not feasible in `flutter_riverpod`](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/issues/134).

This is a limitation by Flutter itself, not riverpod. There are [long standing bugs](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/62861) 
(or [missing features](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/12992) depending on how you view it) 
in flutter with `InheritedWidget` that make it impossible for `context.watch` to work properly. 
Recently there have been [efforts](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/106549) by the creator 
of riverpod to [fix](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/106546) these bugs, 
but [without success](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/107112).

As `jaspr` is basically a complete rewrite of flutters core framework, I went ahead and fixed
these bugs and thereby making `context.watch` feasible.
