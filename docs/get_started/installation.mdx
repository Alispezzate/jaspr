# Installation
*Get started with Jaspr and build your first website in Dart.*

---

Follow the steps below to set up a new Jaspr project on your computer.

## New Project

To get started simply activate the `jaspr` command line tool:

```shell
dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
```

Then create a new project like this:

```
jaspr create my_website
```

This will walk you through the setup wizard and create a new Jaspr project inside the `my_website` folder.

The cli will prompt you with a set of options to configure your project. You can read about what each option
does [below](#project-options) or just start with the recommended ones (simply press **Enter** each time).

<Info>
    If you are just starting out and are not sure what options to pick, just select the default one for each question
    (simply press **Enter** each time).
</Info>

<Info>
    Choosing a set of options do not lock you into a specific configuration. Starting from one setup you can easily
    modify your code to behave as any other setup along the way.
</Info>

After creation, run the development server using the following commands:

```shell
cd my_website
jaspr serve
```

This will spin up a development server at `localhost:8080`.
You can now start developing your website. ðŸŽ‰

<Success>
    Observe that the browser automatically refreshes the page when you change something in your
    code, like the `Welcome` text.
</Success>

## Project Options

When creating a new project, you will go through a set of questions to configure the project to your liking.
The options set your rendering mode, hydration strategy, routing, flutter interoperability strategy and more.

You can choose from the following options:

1. **Rendering Mode**:

Select one of the three rendering modes Jaspr supports. Read about the different modes [here](/core/modes#-rendering-modes).

2. **Hydration** (Conditional Option):

Select the hydration strategy (automatic or manual). Read about hydration [here](/core/modes#-hydration).

3. **Routing**:

Whether to setup routing. Selecting **Yes** will setup a basic `Routing` with two routes ('/home' and '/about'). This gives you a convenient
starting point when you plan to develop a website with multiple pages.

4. **Multi-Page Routing** (Conditional Option):

Whether to setup multi-page or single-page routing, also called server-side or client-side routing respectively. This defined how navigating
between routes will behave. Either a "real" page-load is performed when navigating to a new route (aka. the browser requests the new page using its url from the server).
Or the routing happens purely on the client without any request to the server.

<Info>
    There are different advantages and disadvantages for both types. To help you decide you can find many [articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=multi+page+vs+single+page+site) about this topic.
</Info>

5. **Flutter Embedding**:

Whether to setup an embedded Flutter application with your site. This will use Jasprs first-party integration for [Flutter element embedding](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web#embedding-a-flutter-app-into-an-html-page) and create a simple Flutter counter app that synchronizes its state with your Jaspr site.

6. **Plugin Support**:

Whether to enable support for Flutter web plugins. This will switch to Jasprs custom compiler pipeline (replacing `build_web_compilers`) which allows the use of most Flutter web plugins in your Jaspr site without any additional setup.
*Flutter web plugins* refers to any Flutter plugin from pub.dev that supports web and is not concerned with widgets or rendering. This includes packages like `shared_preferences` or `firebase`.
