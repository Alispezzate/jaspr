# Jaspr CLI
#### Create, serve and build projects using the Jaspr CLI.


---

## Commands

Jaspr comes with a cli tool to create, serve and build your website.

- `jaspr create`: Create a new jaspr project.
- `jaspr serve`: Serve the project and automatically refresh when you make changes.
- `jaspr build`: Build the project according to the selected rendering mode.

Additionally, there are the following service commands available:

- `jaspr doctor`: Show information about the environment and current project.
- `jaspr clean`: Delete the `build/` and `.dart_tool/` directories.
- `jaspr update`: Update the jaspr cli.

## üèó Project Scaffolding

When creating a new project, you will go through a set of questions to configure the project to your liking.
The options set your rendering mode, hydration strategy, routing, flutter interoperability strategy and more.

<Info>
If you are just starting out and are not sure what options to pick, just select the default one for each question
(simply press **Enter** each time).
</Info>

<Info>
Choosing a set of options do not lock you into a specific configuration. Starting from one setup you can easily
modify your code to behave as any other setup along the way.
</Info>

You can choose from the following options:

1. **Rendering Mode**:

  Select one of the three rendering modes Jaspr supports. Read about the different modes [here](/core/modes#-rendering-modes).

2. **Hydration** (Conditional Option):

  Select the hydration strategy (automatic or manual). Read about hydration [here](/core/modes#-hydration).

3. **Routing**:

  Whether to setup routing. Selecting **Yes** will setup a basic `Routing` with two routes ('/home' and '/about'). This gives you a convenient
  starting point when you plan to develop a website with multiple pages.

4. **Multi-Page Routing** (Conditional Option):

  Whether to setup multi-page or single-page routing, also called server-side or client-side routing respectively. This defined how navigating
  between routes will behave. Either a "real" page-load is performed when navigating to a new route (aka. the browser requests the new page using its url from the server).
  Or the routing happens purely on the client without any request to the server.

  <Info>
  There are different advantages and disadvantages for both types. To help you decide you can find many [articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=multi+page+vs+single+page+site) about this topic.
  </Info>

5. **Flutter Embedding**:

  Whether to setup an embedded Flutter application with your site. This will use Jasprs first-party integration for [Flutter element embedding](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web#embedding-a-flutter-app-into-an-html-page) and create a simple Flutter counter app that synchronizes its state with your Jaspr site.

6. **Plugin Support**:

  Whether to enable support for Flutter web plugins. This will switch to Jasprs custom compiler pipeline (replacing `build_web_compilers`) which allows the use of most Flutter web plugins in your Jaspr site without any additional setup.
  *Flutter web plugins* refers to any Flutter plugin from pub.dev that supports web and is not concerned with widgets or rendering. This includes packages like `shared_preferences` or `firebase`.

## üõ† Building

When it's time to deploy your application, you can build it using the following command:

```shell
jaspr build
```

This will build the app inside the `build/jaspr/` directory according to your selected [**Rendering Mode**](/core/modes):

<Tabs defaultValue="st" values={[
    {label: 'static', value: 'st'},
    {label: 'server', value: 'sv'},
    {label: 'client', value: 'c'}
]}>
<TabItem value="st">
All files are built to the `build/jaspr/` directory, which you can deploy to any static hosting provider.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sv">
You can choose whether to build a standalone executable, an aot snapshot or kernel module with the `--target` option.

Your server app will be compiled to `build/jaspr/app<.exe/.aot/.dill>`.

Your static files and assets will be built to the `build/jaspr/web` directory, which must be kept alongside the server executable.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="c">
All files are built to the `build/jaspr/` directory, which you can deploy to any static hosting provider.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
