# Installation
*Get started with Jaspr and build your first website in Dart.*

---

To get started simply activate the `jaspr` command line tool and run `jaspr create`:

```shell
dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
jaspr create my_website
```

This will walk you through the setup wizard and create a new Jaspr project inside the `my_website` folder.

<Info>
    The cli will prompt you with a set of setup options. You can read about what each option does [here](/cli#-project-scaffolding),
    or just start with the recommended ones (simply press **Enter** each time).

    Later on you can easily adapt your project for any other setup if you need to.
</Info>

Next, run the development server using the following commands:

```shell
cd my_website
jaspr serve
```

This will spin up a development server at `localhost:8080`.
You can now start developing your website. ðŸŽ‰
