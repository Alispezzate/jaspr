## 🐶 What is **jaspr**?

**Jaspr** is an modern web framework for building websites in Dart. Jaspr was made with the premise 
to make a web-framework that looks and feels just like Flutter, but renders normal html/css like Vue 
or React. It is targeted mainly at Flutter developers that want to build websites but don't want to 
use Flutter Web (for various reasons). Since it uses Dart, it is also strong in terms of type-safety 
and null-safety compared to JS.

## ⚡️ Core Features

- Familiar component model similar to Flutter widgets
- Easy Server Side Rendering
- Automatic hydration of component data on the client
- Fast incremental DOM updates
- Well tested (~70% test coverage)

## 🚀 Demo and Playground

Inspired by DartPad, **jaspr** has it's own online editor and playground, called **JasprPad**.

[Check it out!](https://jasprpad.schultek.de)

You can check out the samples, take the tutorial or try out jaspr for yourself, all live in the browser. When you want to continue coding offline, you can quickly download the current files bundled in a complete dart project, ready to start coding locally.

JasprPad is also built with **jaspr** itself, so you can check out its source code to get a feel for how jaspr would be used in a larger app.
