# ðŸ¥Š Jaspr vs Flutter Web

As you might know Flutter renders Widgets by manually painting pixels to a canvas. However rendering web-pages
with HTML & CSS works **fundamentally different** to Flutters painting approach. Also Flutter has a vast variety
of widgets with different purposes and styling, whereas in html you can uniquely style each html element however
you like.

Instead of trying to mirror every little thing from Flutter, `jaspr` tries to give a general Fluttery feeling
by matching features where it makes sense without compromising on the unique properties of the web platform.
Rather it **embraces these differences** to give the best of both worlds.

1. The `build()` method of a `StatelessComponent` or `StatefulComponent` returns an `Iterable<Component>`
   instead of a single component. This is because a HTML element can always have multiple child elements.
   The recommended way of using this is with a [**synchronous generator**](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#generators).
   Simply use the `sync*` keyword in the method definition and `yield` one or multiple components:

   ```dart
   class MyComponent extends StatelessComponent {
     @override
     Iterable<Component> build(BuildContext context) sync* {
       yield ChildA();
       yield ChildB();
     } 
   }
   ```

   > Trade-Off: Returning a single component and having an extra multi-child component would be superficial
   to how html works and thereby not a good practice.

2. Jaspr does not care about the styling of components. There are (currently) no prestyled components
   like in Flutters material or cupertino libraries.

   > Trade-Off: Providing styled components would be a lot of extra work and is currently not feasible.
   Also there exist a lot of different, well established CSS frameworks for web that you can already
   integrate and use with jaspr (e.g. [Bulma](https://jasprpad.schultek.de/?sample=bulma)).

3. `Text` receives only a `String` and nothing else. As usual for web, styling is done through a combination
   of CSS attributes, either in a **Stylesheet** or though the **`style` attribute** of the parent elements.

   > Trade-Off: Giving `Text` a style option would be superficial and not native to web, and thereby not
   a good practice.
