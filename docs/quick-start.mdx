# ðŸ›« Quick Start

To get started simply activate the `jaspr` command line tool and run `jaspr create`:

```shell
dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
jaspr create my_website
```

This will setup a new jaspr project inside the `my_website` folder. The cli will prompt you to choose a template.

<Info>
Templates give you a minimal project to get started. Later on you can easily adapt your project for every
architecture and rendering mode. So don't worry if you are not sure yet what to choose.
</Info>

Next, run the development server using the following commands:

```shell
cd my_website
jaspr serve
```

This will spin up a development server at `localhost:8080`.
You can now start developing your website. ðŸŽ‰

<Success>
Observe that the browser automatically refreshes the page when you change something in your 
code, like the `Hello World` text.
</Success>

## ðŸª† Project structure

Depending on your chosen template, your jaspr project will have the following project structure:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="basic"
    values={[
        {label: 'Basic', value: 'basic'},
        {label: 'Client', value: 'client'},
        {label: 'Server', value: 'server'},
    ]}
>
    <TabItem value="basic">
        ```markdown
        â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
        â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app.dart
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ jaspr_options.dart
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles.dart
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.dart
        â”œâ”€â”€ web/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
        â”œâ”€â”€ pubspec.lock
        â””â”€â”€ pubspec.yaml
        ```

        - The `lib` folder contains all your usual dart code, including components, services, pages, routes etc.
          depending on your architecture.

        - The `lib/main.dart` file is the entry point for your **server** application. It calls `runApp()`
          and provides your root app component.

        - The `lib/jaspr_options.dart` is auto-generated by Jasprs tooling. It exposes a top-level `defaultJasprOptions`
          that you should provide to the `Jaspr.initializeApp(options: ...)` call inside `lib/main.dart`.

        - The `web` folder is optional and may contain any public assets you want to access from your website, like images
          or fonts.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="client">
        ```markdown
        â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app.dart
        â”œâ”€â”€ web/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css

        â”œâ”€â”€ pubspec.lock
        â””â”€â”€ pubspec.yaml
        ```

        - The `lib` folder contains all your usual dart code, including components, services, pages, routes etc.
        depending on your architecture.

        - The `web` folder contains all files that should be shipped to the browser. Files inside the `web` directory
        are later accessible through their relative url, e.g. `<domain>/styles.css`, so it makes sense to put
        all your public assets inside this folder (e.g. images). All `.dart` files will be compiled to
        js and will be accessible through e.g. `<domain>/main.dart.js`.
