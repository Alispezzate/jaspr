# ðŸ›« Quick Start

To get started simply activate the `jaspr` command line tool and run `jaspr create`:

```shell
dart pub global activate jaspr_cli
jaspr create my_website
```

This will walk you through the setup wizard and create a new Jaspr project inside the `my_website` folder.

<Info>
The cli will prompt you with a set of setup options. If you are not sure yet what to choose, go with the recommended one
(simply press Enter each time). Later on you can easily adapt your project for any other setup if you need to.
</Info>

Next, run the development server using the following commands:

```shell
cd my_website
jaspr serve
```

This will spin up a development server at `localhost:8080`.
You can now start developing your website. ðŸŽ‰

<Success>
Observe that the browser automatically refreshes the page when you change something in your 
code, like the `Hello World` text.
</Success>

## ðŸª† Project structure

Depending on your chosen [*Rendering Mode*](/cli#-rendering-modes) and *Hydration* setting, your Jaspr project will have the following project structure:

<Tabs defaultValue="staticserver" values={[
    {label: 'Static / Server, Automatic Hydration', value: 'sa'},
    {label: 'Static / Server, Manual Hydration', value: 'sm'},
    {label: 'Client', value: 'c'}
]}
>
<TabItem value="sa">

```

- The `lib` directory contains all your usual dart code, including components, pages, routes etc.
  depending on your architecture.

- The `lib/main.dart` file is the entry point for your **server** application. It calls `runApp()`
  and provides your root document component.

- The optional `lib/jaspr_options.dart` is auto-generated by Jasprs tooling. It exposes a top-level `defaultJasprOptions`
  that you should provide to the `Jaspr.initializeApp(options: ...)` call inside `lib/main.dart`.

- The `web` directory contains any static assets you want to access from your website, like images or fonts.
  Files inside this directory are later accessible through their relative url, e.g. `<domain>/images/logo.png`.

  the main app component.
