# @css / css()
*Utility to write nested style rules.*

---

The `css()` method takes a selector and an optional list of children and returns a `StyleRule`. You can then use the
same style group methods on that rule as you can with normal styles.

Nested style rules will be scoped to the parent. Using the `&` symbol as part of a child selector
refers to whatever the parent selected.

---

There are also additional `StyleRule` variants that support other css features:

- `StyleRule.import(String url)` renders a `@import url(...)` statement.
- `StyleRule.media({MediaRuleQuery query, List<StyleRule> styles})` renders a `@media ... { ... }` statement.
- `StyleRule.fontFace({String fontFamily, FontStyle? fontStyle, String url})` renders a `@font-face { ... }` statement.
