# @sync
*Easy data synchronization with support for custom data types.*

## Alternatives

- Check out the [SyncStateMixin](/utils/sync_state_mixin) for a more explicit way to sync state of a `StatefulComponent`
  between server and client (this is used by `@sync` under the hood).

- Check out [@client](/utils/at_client) components, that support passing data from the server to the client as part
of the component parameters, including support for custom data types.
