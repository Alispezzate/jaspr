## ♻️ Syncing Data to the Client

Alongside with preloading some data on the server, you often want to also sync the data with the client.
You can simply add the `SyncStateMixin` which will automatically sync state from the server with the client.

The `SyncStateMixin` accepts a second type argument for the data type that you want to sync. You then have to
implement the `getState` and `updateState()` methods.

```dart
class MyState extends State<MyStatefulComponent> with SyncStateMixin<MyStatefulComponent, MyStateModel> {

MyStateModel? model;

// a globally unique id that is used to identify the state
@override
String get syncId => 'my_id';

// this will get the state to be sent to the client
// and is only executed on the server
@override
MyStateModel? getState() {
return model;
}

// this will receive the state on the client
// and it is safe to call setState
void updateState(MyStateModel? value) {
setState(() {
model = value;
});
}
}
```

In order to send the data, it needs to be serialized on the server and deserialized on the client.
The serialization format is defined by the `syncCodec` getter defined in `SyncStateMixin`.

The codec must encode to a primitive or object value of one of the supported types: `Null, bool,
double, int, Uint8List, String, Map, List`. By default, the codec is null and your state must
already be one of the supported types.

When you want to use another type like a custom model class, you have to override the `syncCodec` getter, which
has to return a `Codec` that encodes to `String`. This can be any codec, however a typical use would be to
encode your model to `Map<String, dynamic>` and the fuse this with the json codec to get a json string.

```dart

class MyState extends State<MyStatefulComponent> with SyncStateMixin<MyStatefulComponent, MyStateModel> {

@override
Codec<MyStateModel, String> get syncCodec => MyStateModelCodec();

...
}

// codec that encodes a value of MyStateModel to Map<String, dynamic>
class MyStateModelCodec extends Codec<MyStateModel, Map<String, dynamic>> {

...

}
```
